# Metabarcoding of human guts: Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) study
  By: Nicole Benjamin, Megan Buff & Kim Bonanno
  
# Background
  The Fecal Microbiome Transplant study subdataset was adapted from research paper "Microbiota Transfer Therapy alters gut ecosystem and improves gastrointestinal and autism symptoms: an open-label study" (Kang et al., 2017). In this study, researchers are trying to identify if a fecal microbiome transplant would help alleviate both autisim spectrum disorder and gastrointestinal symptoms.
 
  Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability which has a wide range of symptoms depending on the individual. The severity of ASD is assesed by several different system. Kang utilized Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), the Parent Global Impressions-III (PGI-III), and Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS). There has been a correlation with individuals with ASD tend to have more gastrointestinal problems than those who do not have ASD (Hsiao et al., 2014). The Gastrointestinal(GI) Tract consists of all of the organs which foods and liquids travel from digestion to excretion. It has been found that ASD individuals most commonly experience the following sympotms: chronic constipation, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.
